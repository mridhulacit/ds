in general,compiler will optimize our program inorder to complete work as soon as possible
but in multithreaded programs, we mayn declare a while loop at some place and 
the value of that respective variable may get changed in some other part of the program which may not be
known by the compiler,so here optimization is not preferable

if we use volatile keyword here then compiler will not optimize that part of the program.

Actions on objects so declared shall not be ‘‘optimized out’’ 
by an implementation or reordered except as permitted by the rules for evaluating expressions
