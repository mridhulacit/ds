VOID POINTER:-
a void pointer is a pointer that has no data type.it can hold address of any data type and
can be type casted to any type.
void pointers cannot be dereferenced withour typecasting and arithmetic operations arent allowed over 
void pointer

ADVANTAGES:
malloc() and calloc() return void * type and this allows these functions to allocate memory
 of any data type and void pointers are used to implement genric functions in c
