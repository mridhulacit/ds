A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deleted (or freed) is called dangling pointer

there are 3 different situations when a pointer acts as a dangling pointer

1.De-allocation of memory
when memory pointed by a pointer is deallocated then its dangling pointer
i.e.,free(ptr),now ptr becomes dangling pointer

2.Function call
when a pointer pointing to a local variable of a Function it becomes 
dangling when local variable is not static.

3.variable goes out of scope:
When a pointer pointing to a variable goes out of scope then the pointer becomes dangling
