oops-object oriented programming language
oops is a way of solving problems by dividing them into smaller problems using objects
initially programs were written in procedural language,where we had a long list of instructions.
simply,oops is a programming methodology to organize complex program into simple programs by using concepts
such as,
1.ABSTRACTION
2.ENCAPSULATION
3.HIERARCHY
INHERITANCE
4.MODULARITY
POLYMORPHISM
these are the major pilars of oops 
also we have another 3 minor pillars
1.CONCURRENCY
2.PERSISTENCE
3.TYPING(types) - strongly types vs loosly types
so there are 7 pillars(features) of oops
in oops we write programs using classes and objects inorder to utilize these features.

**The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them 
so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

1.ABSTRACTION:-
