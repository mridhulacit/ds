//virtual functions are mainly used to acheive runtim polymorphism
//A virtual function a member function which is declared within a base class and is
// re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class
//when we creat a pointer for the bass class and it refers to derived class,you can call,
//a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.
//virtual function sses that,correct function to be called for an object.
//virtual function sees where does the pointer points,it never sees for what type the pointer is created.
//it never checks its base or derived class pointer, if base pointer refers to derived class object
//then derived class virtual functions are executed
//these are mainly for the purpose of acheiving runtime polymorphism
//these are declared with a virtual keyword
//here function call process takes place during runtime.
               //RULES FOR VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS//
//1.virtual functions cannot be static or friend function of another class
//2.Virtual functions should be accessed using pointer or reference of base class type 
//to achieve run time polymorphism.
//3.The prototype of virtual functions should be same in base as well as derived class.
//4.They are always defined in base class and overridden in derived class. It is not mandatory for 
//derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case base class version of 
//function is used.
//5.A class may have virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.
                      //working of vtable and vptr//
//If object of that class is created then a virtual pointer(VPTR) is inserted as a data member of the 
//class to point to VTABLE of that class. For each new object created, a new virtual pointer is 
//inserted as a data member of that class.
//Irrespective of object is created or not, a static array of function pointer called VTABLE
//where each cell contains the address of each virtual function contained in that class.
//Initially, we create a pointer of type base class and initialize it with the address of the derived class 
//object. When we create an object of the derived class, the compiler creates a pointer as a data member 
//of the class containing the address of VTABLE of the derived class.
