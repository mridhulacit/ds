//polymorphism is the ability of a message to be displayed more than in one form.TO be accurate,
//the ability of a function to perform in more then one way for different situations.
//basic example is:-human can walk,run,eat but in different situations style may get differ 
//or general activities like walk,eat will be performed by every human being and name,age,height,weight
//are the general details of a person but this differs for each one everthing will be 
//performed and owned by every human being but in a different way for each
//now,lets take name,age,height,weight as data members 
//walk() and eat() as member functions
//now lets define walk() and eat() ,they can be called several times for different person
//here,function overloading takes place,where each function is called several times with 
//several arguments or different data types for which they behave in different ways.
//Function overloading is the ability of a function to perform tasks in different ways.
//Function overloading is using a single function name to perform different types of tasks,then 
//these functions are said to be overloaded.
//Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
//we have another overloading called operator overloading,which overloads operators
//The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviours in different instances
// is known as operator overloading.
//these two overloadings makes polymorphism.
//we have 2 types of polymorphism they are, compiler and run time polymorphism
//function overloading and operator overloading comes under compiler polymorphism
//whereas,there is another concept called overridding that comes under run time polymorphism.
