DECLARATION :
        declaration gives information about name of the variable, type of value it holds and the initial 
value if any it takes. i.e., declaration gives details about the properties of a variable. 
        A variable or a function can be declared any number of times.
        Memory will not be allocated during declaration.
example:-
    extern int a;

    int f(int);
The above is a function declaration. This declaration is just for informing the compiler that a 
function named f with return type and argument as int will be used in the function.

DEFINITION:
        Definition of a variable says where the variable gets stored. 
i.e., memory for the variable is allocated during the definition of the variable.
        A variable or a function can be defined only once.
        Memory will be allocated.
example:-
int a;

int f(int a)
{
  return a;
} 
The system allocates memory by seeing the above function definition.

INITIALIZATION:
         Initialization is the specification of the initial value to be stored in an object, 
which is not necessarily the same as the first time you explicitly assign a value to it.
